## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- **Predictive Analytics for E-commerce**: Built a recommendation system that predicts products a user might be interested in based on their past behavior and preferences.

- **PAN Card (Permanent Account Number)  Tempering Detection**: Created a PAN card tempering detector model that helps banks and financial institutions detecting whether the ID(pan card) provided to them is original or not.
   
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service like a streaming platform. By analyzing user behavior and demographics, I indentified potential churners and suggested preventive actions.

- [**Image Classification for food**](https://github.com/khanabdulmajid/tensorflow_deep_learning/blob/main/07_Project_1_Food_Vision.ipynb): Built a deep learning model that can classify food images (101 diff. types).
