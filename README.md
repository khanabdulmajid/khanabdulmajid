## My Projects

### Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

#### 1. Dog Breed Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
##### Project Overview: Developed a machine learning model to classify dog breeds from images with high accuracy. The project involved data preprocessing, model building, and deployment.
  - Collected and preprocessed a dataset of dog images from various sources.
  - Built and fine-tuned a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.
  - Implemented data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.
  - Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
  - Deployed the model using Flask for creating a user-friendly web application interface.
##### Technologies and Tools: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Flask.

#### 2. Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV's Haar Casdcade
##### Project Overview: Developed a real-time car detection system using OpenCV and cascade classifiers. The project aimed to detect cars in images and video streams with high accuracy.
Key Responsibilities:

  - Gathered and labeled a dataset of car images for training the cascade classifier.
  - Created and trained the cascade classifier using OpenCV.
  - Implemented a real-time car detection system that processes video streams.
  - Optimized the detection algorithm to improve speed and accuracy.
  - Evaluated the system's performance using precision and recall metrics.

##### Technologies and Tools: Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade Classifier, NumPy.

#### 3. Predictive Analytics for E-commerce: Built a recommendation system that predicts products a user might be interested in based on their past behavior and preferences.

#### 4. PAN Card (Permanent Account Number)  Tempering Detection: Created a PAN card tempering detector model that helps banks and financial institutions detecting whether the ID(pan card) provided to them is original or not.
   
#### 5. Customer Churn Prediction**: Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service like a streaming platform. By analyzing user behavior and demographics, I indentified potential churners and suggested preventive actions.

#### 6. [Image Classification for food](https://github.com/khanabdulmajid/tensorflow_deep_learning/blob/main/07_Project_1_Food_Vision.ipynb): Built a deep learning model that can classify food images (101 diff. types).
