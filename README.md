## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- **Predictive Analytics for E-commerce**: Built a recommendation system that predicts products a user might be interested in based on their past behavior and preferences.

- **Credit Risk Assessment**: Created a credit risk assessment model that helps banks and financial institutions determine the creditworthiness of loan applicants.
   
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Developed a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service like a streaming platform. By analyzing user behavior and demographics, I indentified potential churners and suggested preventive actions.

- **Image Classification for food**: Built a deep learning model that can classify food images (101 diff. types).
