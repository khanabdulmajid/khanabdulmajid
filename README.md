## 🚧 Featured Projects

Here are some of the projects I’m proud of:

### 1. 🏥 Health Prediction Using MEPS Dataset
**Overview:** Built a complete **Machine Learning pipeline** using the **Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)** dataset to predict health outcomes based on demographic and medical attributes.  
**Highlights:**  
- Performed **data analysis and feature engineering** to identify key predictors of health status.  
- Handled **class imbalance** using **ADASYN** for improved minority class representation.  
- Trained and optimized an **XGBoost Classifier** with `use_label_encoder=False` and `eval_metric='logloss'`.  
- Evaluated performance using **ROC-AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  
- Prepared the model for **Django deployment** with API integration for real-time predictions.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, ADASYN, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Django

### 2. 🧭 Machine Learning Dashboard (Django)
**Overview:** Developed an interactive **ML Dashboard** to visualize insights and deploy machine learning models through a **Django web interface**.  
**Highlights:**  
- Migrated an existing **Streamlit dashboard** into **Django** for better customization and scalability.  
- Integrated a pre-trained **XGBoost model** for on-demand predictions.  
- Embedded an **admin dashboard HTML template** for modern UI/UX.  
- Implemented **form-based file uploads**, result visualization, and API endpoints for automation.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, XGBoost

### 3. 🐶 Dog Breed Classifier (CNN)
**Overview:** Designed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify dog breeds from image data with high accuracy.  
**Highlights:**  
- Preprocessed and augmented image datasets for robust model training.  
- Fine-tuned CNN architecture using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.  
- Deployed via **Flask** for a user-friendly web interface.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Flask  

---

### 4. 🎨 Deep Convolutional GAN for Color Image Generation
**Overview:** Implemented a **DCGAN** to generate realistic color images using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**.  
**Highlights:**  
- Applied **batch normalization** and **Leaky ReLU** for improved training stability.  
- Gained deep understanding of **GAN architecture** and training challenges.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras
