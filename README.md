## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I'm proud of:

- **Predictive Analytics for E-commerce**: Build a recommendation system that predicts products a user might be interested in based on their past behavior and preferences. You can use collaborative filtering or content-based - recommendation techniques.

- **Credit Risk Assessment**: Create a credit risk assessment model that helps banks and financial institutions determine the creditworthiness of loan applicants. This project can involve building a classification model using historical data.

- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service like a streaming platform. By analyzing user behavior and demographics, you can identify potential churners and take preventive actions.

- **Image Classification for food: Build a deep learning model that can classify food images (101 diff. types).
